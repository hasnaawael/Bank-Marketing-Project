# Bank Credit Project 💰
## Overview
Welcome to the Bank Credit Project! This project is designed to analyze the "Bank Marketing" dataset, providing valuable insights and predicting whether a new customer will accept a deposit offer or not. The project is structured to guide you through the various stages of the data analysis and machine learning process.

## Project Structure
1. Import Libraries 📚
In this section, we import the necessary Python libraries that will be used throughout the project. These libraries include tools for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

2. Data Understanding 🐝
Here, we delve into understanding the dataset. This includes exploring the basic statistics, data types, and gaining insights into the features and target variable. Understanding the data is crucial for making informed decisions during the analysis.

3. Explore Every Feature in the Dataset (EDA) 📊
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in uncovering patterns and relationships within the dataset. This section focuses on visualizing the data, identifying outliers, and understanding the distribution of key features. EDA is essential for guiding further analysis.

4. Data Preparation for ML Algorithms (Encoding) 🛠
To prepare the data for machine learning algorithms, we handle missing values and encode categorical variables. This step ensures that the dataset is in a suitable format for training and evaluating machine learning models.

5. Building and Training Model 0️⃣1️⃣
This section involves selecting a suitable machine learning model, training it on the prepared dataset, and evaluating its performance. We explore different algorithms and fine-tune parameters to achieve the best predictive accuracy.

6. Results Summary 📝
The final section summarizes the key findings from the analysis and the performance of the machine learning model. It provides insights into the factors that influence a customer's decision to accept a deposit offer and serves as a conclusion to the project.
